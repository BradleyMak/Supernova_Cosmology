# Supernova Cosmology Project
This project uses type 1a supernova data from [1] (milestone) and [2] (extension) to determine the <b>present-day cosmological density parameters</b>, $Ω_{i,0}$, appearing in the Friedmann equation:

$$𝐻^2(𝑎) = \frac{𝐻_0^2 Ω_{𝑅,0}}{𝑎^4} + \frac{𝐻_0^2 Ω_{𝑀,0}}{𝑎^3} + 𝐻_0^2 Ω_{Λ,0} − \frac{𝑘𝑐^2}{R_0 𝑎^2}$$

where $c$ is the speed of light, $H(a)$ is the Hubble parameter,  $H_0$ is its present-day value (taken to be $H_0$ = 75km/s/Mpc in the milestone project), $a$ is the scale factor, defined by $𝑟(𝑡)=𝑎(𝑡) 𝑟_0$, $k$ is a constant which determines the geometry of the Universe, and $R_0$ is the curvature scale factor.
